A transmission information calculator site that I host at http://ecik.youhavethewrong.info/tic


Random notes
===

engine rotation - transmission ratio - axle ratio (final ratio)
gear ratio - the number of times a gear has to turn to turn another gear
if the input gear has fewer teeth, it is "gearing up"
if the input gear has more teeth, it is "gearing down"
